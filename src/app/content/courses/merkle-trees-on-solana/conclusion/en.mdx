# Conclusion

Congratulations! You've completed the Secp256r1 on Solana course. You now have a solid understanding of how Secp256r1 works on Solana and its role in enabling modern authentication methods.

<ArticleSection name="What you've learned" id="what-you-learned" level="h2" />

Throughout this course, you've gained essential knowledge about:
- The fundamentals of Secp256r1 (NIST P-256) elliptic curve cryptography
- How Solana implements Secp256r1 signature verification through its precompile
- The relationship between Secp256r1 and modern authentication methods like passkeys
- How to implement secure signature verification in your programs
- Best practices for using PDAs with Secp256r1 public keys

<ArticleSection name="Next Steps" id="next-steps" level="h2" />

You're now ready to start building secure authentication systems using Secp256r1 on Solana! Here are some recommended next steps:

1. Experiment with implementing Secp256r1 signature verification in your own programs
2. Explore the [Challenges section](/en/challenges) for hands-on exercises
3. Consider how you can use Secp256r1 to improve your application's security
4. Join our community to share your implementations and get help

Remember that while Secp256r1 provides the cryptographic foundation, implementing secure authentication requires careful consideration of:
- Proper signature verification
- Secure key management
- Protection against replay attacks
- User experience considerations

Don't be afraid to experiment and make mistakes; that's how we learn and grow in the field of cryptography and security!
