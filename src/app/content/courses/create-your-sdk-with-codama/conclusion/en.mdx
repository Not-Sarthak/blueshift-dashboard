# Conclusion

Congratulations! You've completed the `Create your SDK with Codama` course. You now have a solid foundation in understanding how Codama IDL works, from its core concepts to practical implementation details.

## What You've Learned

Throughout this course, you've gained essential knowledge about:
- What is Codama and how `nodes`, `visitors` and `renderers` are used
- How to build a Codama IDL from scratch
- How to build a Codama IDL from an Anchor IDL and update it if needed

## Next Steps

You're now ready to start building your first SDK with Codama! The best way to solidify your knowledge is through hands-on practice. We encourage you to:

1. Head to the [Challenges section](/en/challenges)
2. Create an SDK for one of the program
3. Use the SDK to build some test for your program
4. Join our community to share your progress and get help
